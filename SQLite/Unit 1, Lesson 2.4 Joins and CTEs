Drills: Using Joins and CTEs

1. What are the three longest trips on rainy days?
2. Which station is empty most often?
3. Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips start at that station but ordered by dock count.
4. (Challenge) What's the third longest trip for each day it rains anywhere?


1. I'm going to interpret this question as, "What are the three longest trips out of all the trips that took place on rainy days?" To complete this query, I need to join the tables on zip code, where the Events column is in 'Rain' or 'Rain-Fog', and take the three longest durations in the resulting table. By trip ID, the three longest rainy-day trips are: 1210487, 1244903, 1011634.

SELECT
	trips.duration,
	trips.trip_id,
	trips.zip_code,
	weather.Events,
	weather.ZIP
FROM
	trips
JOIN 
	weather
ON
	trips.zip_code = weather.ZIP
WHERE 
	weather.Events in ('Rain', 'Fog-Rain')
GROUP BY trips.trip_id
ORDER BY trips.duration DESC
LIMIT 3

Result: 
"83915"	"1210487"	"94301"	"Rain"	"94301"
"81687"	"1244903"	"94301"	"Rain"	"94301"
"81484"	"1011634"	"94063"	"Rain"	"94063"

2. The status table records the hourly status of each station, noting how many bikes are available, and how many docks are available. The query below creates an 'empty' case where there are no bikes available, then counts how often 'empty' occurs, grouped by station id. The three most frequently empty stations are stations 62, 45, and 63.

SELECT
	(CASE WHEN bikes_available = 0 THEN 'empty' ELSE 'available' END) empty,
	COUNT(*) as empty_freq,
	station_id
FROM status
WHERE empty like 'empty'
GROUP BY station_id
ORDER BY empty_freq DESC
LIMIT 3

"empty"	"20646"	"62"
"empty"	"15318"	"45"
"empty"	"13927"	"63"

3. The query below returns the number of trips that started at each station, ordered by the number of docks at each station. Although there are 67 stations in the stations table, the join returns only 63 rows. There may be an issue with the query, or perhaps trips were not started at 4 of the stations. If there is a problem with the query, then maybe an intermediate join with a table recording counts of start_station needs to be used.

SELECT
	trips.start_station,
    COUNT(*) trip_count,
	stations.name,
	stations.dockcount
FROM
    trips
JOIN 
	stations
ON
	trips.start_station = stations.name
GROUP BY stations.name
ORDER BY stations.dockcount

4. The challenge in identifying the third longest trip for eay day that it rains anywhere is that the trips and weather tables do not have a date column in common. 

The first step is to create a common table "dates" using a CTE that extracts the first 10 characters of the start_date column (containing a full timestamp) of the trips table, and assign it to a trip_date column. Then, this common table is joined with trips on trip_id. Next, the trips table is joined with the weather table, where only the dates with "Rain" in the Events column are included. So far, so good.

Next, the Max trip duration is extracted from the trips column, provided it is not in the max, which is not in the max. The goal here is to get the third longest trip. Unfortunately, this still isn't quite right--it fails to get the third longest trip for each day in the dataset. I'm not sure how to complete this exercise.

WITH 
	dates
AS (
SELECT
	SUBSTR(start_date, 1, 10) trip_date,
	trip_id
FROM
	trips
)
SELECT
    dates.trip_id,
	dates.trip_date,
	trips.duration,
	trips.trip_id,
	weather.Events,
	weather.Date
FROM
    dates
JOIN
    trips
ON
    dates.trip_id = trips.trip_id
JOIN 
	weather
ON
	dates.trip_date = weather.Date
WHERE 
	weather.Events in ('Rain', 'Fog-Rain') AND trips.duration NOT IN (SELECT MAX(trips.duration) FROM trips 
		WHERE trips.duration NOT IN (SELECT MAX(trips.duration) FROM trips))
ORDER BY weather.Date, trips.duration DESC
