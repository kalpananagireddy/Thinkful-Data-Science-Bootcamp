Drill: Using SQL to pull aggregated data from the Bay Area Bikeshare dataset

1. What was the hottest day in our data set? Where was that?
2. How many trips started at each station?
3. What's the shortest trip that happened?
4. What is the average trip duration, by end station?

1. The day with the highest mean temperature (94F) was September 11th, 2015, at zipcode 94063. The "hottest day" could also be interpreted as the day with the highest maximum temperature, in which case the hottest day was November 17th, 2015 at 94063, with a maximum temperature of 134F. (This value is suspect, since a temperature of 134F during autumn in the Bay Area is unlikely!)

SELECT
    date,
	ZIP,
	MAX(MeanTemperatureF) MeanTemperatureF
FROM
    weather
GROUP by date
ORDER BY MeanTemperatureF DESC
LIMIT 1

Returns: "2015-09-11"	"94063"	"94"

SELECT
    date,
	ZIP,
	MAX(MaxTemperatureF) MaxTemperatureF
FROM
    weather
GROUP by date
ORDER BY MaxTemperatureF DESC
LIMIT 1

Returns:
"2015-11-17"	"94063"	"134"

2. The query below returned the number of trips started at each station. There were 80 unique stations, and the number of trips per station ranges from 1 to 23,591.

SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS num_trips_started, 
	start_station
FROM
    trips
GROUP by start_station

3. The shortest trip duration is 60 seconds. The problem with the query below is that it returned only one row, while in fact, many trips had a duration of 60 seconds. If we wanted to know all of them, we'd need to modify the query. If we only care about the shortest duration, then we could omit any reference to trip_id.

SELECT
    trip_id,
	MIN(duration) as duration
FROM
    trips
    
Returns:
"1011650"	"60"

4. The average trip duration, aggregated by end station, ranges from 257 to 4710.9. (There are 80 stations, so the complete results are not reproduced here.)

SELECT
    end_station,
	AVG(duration) as mean_duration
FROM
    trips
GROUP BY end_station
ORDER BY mean_duration DESC
